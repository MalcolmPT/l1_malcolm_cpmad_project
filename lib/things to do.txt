The issue with the drawer not working on your AboutUsPage is likely due to the use of Scaffold.of(context).openDrawer() within the StatelessWidget. When you use Scaffold.of(context), it needs to be within a widget that is a descendant of a Scaffold. If the context used is not directly from a widget that's a descendant of the Scaffold, it may cause the drawer not to work as expected.
